# About De

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, my name is [Luan](https://twitter.com/LuanGjokaj) a UX Engineer & Designer. ReactFondue came as a side project, driven by the necessity to have a solid infrastructure using React, ready to go in no time ðŸš€. The goal is to have a clean and minimal setup out of the box, SEO friendly and optimized. A development environment with all the ingredients. Supporting code splitting, hot module reload and server side rendering.

It is an open source project, contributions are welcome!
